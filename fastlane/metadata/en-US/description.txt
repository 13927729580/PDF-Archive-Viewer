THE WORKFLOW

• Scan all incoming documents with PDF Archiver.

THE CONCEPT

PDF Archiver saves your documents by the following naming convention:

2017-01-02--blue-jeans__bill_clothes.pdf
2018-04-30--launch-in-berlin__work_travel.pdf

This structure is independent from your OS and filesystem and makes it very easy to search files ...
• ... by tag via a searchterm like: "_tagname", starting with _
• ... by description via a searchterm like: "-descriptionword", starting with "-"
• ... by tag or description via a searchterm like: "searchword", starting with the term
